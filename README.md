Solution for Coursework 2 - Autonomous Drone Sensor Collecting

This is my implementation for a task during my Informatics Large Practical coursework. The task is based on a drone used to collect sensor readings, 
around a specific confinement zone in central Edinburgh.

All distances are in degrees, and all points are in latitiude and longitude coordinates.
