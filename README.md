Here is my repository for my project for Informatics Large Practical.

Solution for Coursework 2 - Autonomous Drone Sensor Collecting

This is my implementation for a task during my Informatics Large Practical coursework. 

## Task
The task is based on a drone used to collect sensor readings, analysing urban air quality,
around a specific confinement zone in central Edinburgh, for a hyperthetical, small-scale
study around the University of Edinburgh's Central Area

All distances are in degrees, and all points are in latitiude and longitude coordinates.
